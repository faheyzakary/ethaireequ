Find out more information: This video demonstrates how to use STMicroelectronics' built-in STM32 USB bootloader to program Question Anyone found a way? I know about using the ST Electronics boot loader demonstrator if it was a Windows machine, but I can't get it to flash using Betaflight configurator on MacOS. When I connect the Elf to USB with the boot button held (Elf stays quiet, no lights or noise), the configurator finds a SLAB USB to UART port, but attempting to flash gives me the "STM32 communication failed, wrong response" error.

Now when I go to replace driver it instantly says it failed. For more info I am using an old Windows 7 rig and I installed Hi guys, you are my last chance before I throw it. I've tried everything, from shorting the boot pins to ImpulseRC, and also flashing it manually with STM. When I connect it with the boot pins shorted, if I open ImpulseRC it keep staying in "Searching a flight controller", if I connect it to Betaflight it's never on DFU and if I try to flash it, it will says errors like "No response from bootloader" or "Communication with bootloader failed". Also I've tried every combination of settings Arduino STM32. Hardware files to support STM32 boards, on Arduino IDE 1.8.x including LeafLabs Maple and other generic STM32F103 boards - rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32. I know this topic has come up before but my issue is different. When I get to the point where I use Zadig to switch the STM32 Bootloader driver over to the WinUSB the USB connecting and disconnecting sound just goes on and off consistently until I switch back the driver. I've had this happen on two different machines, both Win7. If you don't know how to get around that is there another way to flash? Can I use an FTDI and one of the UARTs or something like that? I've also tried the instruct. Posted on March 24, 2018 at 04:16  Hi, In my current project, I'm using STM32F070RG with USB mass storage class, DFU class, and CDC class. Currently, the project is in development so I'm using the ST VID and PID (default comes from cubeMX code). 
I can enter DFU mode and flash easily but there is no com port associated the the omnibus, it was COM 10 before I reflashed it to betaflight 3.1.7 (it was on 3.0.1 and that didn't have dshot). the device shows up in windows but not in betaflight as it has no com port. I have already tried all the usual stuff, restarting my pc, I've reinstalling the stm32 virtual com port drivers but it's still not working.

When I first opened it up I connected it to my computer through Betaflight with the appropriate drivers and it successfully connected. After that I went to work soldering all the plugs on. Well, two days later I go to plug it in to my computer and I get nothing. В итоге драйвер для usb-интерфейса микроконтроллера stm32 в dfu-режиме. I recently purchased a racewhoop v1, and can get it to connect in betaflight in DFU mode, but I can't get it to connect to configure it. I believe it's the FC used in the Moskito 70, of that helps anything at all. I have gone trough Joshua Bardwell's video on connecting to cleanflight/betaflight, and it has not helped at all. I've followed all of the same steps, and it still refuses to connect outside of DFU mode. I have properly installed the bootloader driver, the STM32 VCP driver Make sure you have zadig if you're using Windows to enable the DFU driver. Instructions:  but you may need to install the STM VCP driver (see below) for Betaflight Configurator to connect to  (echo '# DFU (Internal bootloader for STM32 MCUs)' echo 'ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM. 
Today while installing the WinUSB driver using Zadig I forgot to power the board up in DFU and installed the driver onto the OmnibusF4 device instead of the STM32 BOOTLOADER. Now I cannot connect to the board through Betaflight or Zadig. Is there anything Q- How To Manually Install DFU Driver. In most cases, Windows will generally automatically install the necessary DFU Drivers with the install of Roborun+. I can flash it in DFU using betaflight firmware flasher, but the thing is each time i connect it to my pc, it switches to DFU mode after 5 seconds. I've got two lux cards, and the same happens with both. I spent half an hour at work on a windows 10, I installed cp210x Drivers, STM USB VCP Drivers and Zadig one for DFU and was able to flash it. After that, can't connect to it, even if under windows it doesn't switch automatically to DFU. I have no problem to connect to my naze32. Environment.
